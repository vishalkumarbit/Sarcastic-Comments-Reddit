# Sarcastic-Comments-Reddit
Sarcastic comment detection using deep learning.


We were provided with 1.3 million comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit. The dataset was generated by scraping comments 
from Reddit containing the sarcasm tag. This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant 
to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content.
So the challenge of this problem is to build a sarcasm detector which can detect sarcasm in the posted comments.


Given labelled data, we have to predict whether it’s a sarcastic comment or not. The target variable we have here is boolean. 
So, it is a binary classification problem.
There are text features present in the dataset so we can say that it’s an NLP(Natural language processing) task. 
Hence, we can apply various NLP models like CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM etc. can be used to detect sarcasm in the comment.
